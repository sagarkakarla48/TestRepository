# Transpose Matrix Properties

 If r is a scalar element and A and B represent matrices:

1. 
	((A)^T)^T=A
	
	shows that the transpose of a transpose matrix is the original matrix

2. 
	(A + B)^T=A^T + B^T
	
	shows that the transpose of two added matrices is the same as the addition of the two transpose matrices

3. 
	(rA)T=rA^T
	
	shows that when a scalar element is multiplied to a matrix, the order of transposition is irrelevant

4. 
	(AB)^T=B^T * A^T
	
	shows that the transpose of a product of matrices equals the product of their transposes in reverse order
