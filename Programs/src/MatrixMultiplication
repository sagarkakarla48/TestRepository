If we multiply a 2×3 matrix with a 3×1 matrix, the product matrix is 2×1

product of two matrices general example
Here is how we get M11 and M12 in the product.

M11 = r11× t11  +  r12× t21  +   r13×t31 
M12 = r21× t11  +  r22× t21   +  r23×t31

Note: Two matrices A and B can be multiplied only in case of Columns of A equals to rows of B otherwise it results undefined.
